Hello,
Thank you for reviewing my excercise program!
This program make reddit api call to retrieve the top Posts with most up votes and Users with most posts. 
Please note:
1) all credential was hard coded for your convenience to run the program.
2) The program will run for 6 minutes and pull report every 3 minutes. These can be change by update there variables in program.cs
        int durationMillSec = 6 * 60 * 1000; // 6 minutes
        int waitTimeToretrieveInfo = 3 * 60 * 1000; // 3 minutes

Thank you again!

Paul
